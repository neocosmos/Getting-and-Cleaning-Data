# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project

###The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The raw data set for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

###When the data has been down loaded and unzipped, set the directory as the working directory and source the R script called "run_analysis.R". 

###The output of the R script is "tidy-dataset.txt". 

###The variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data is described in "CodeBook.md".
